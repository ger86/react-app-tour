# â›© Create a tour by the application with React

## Description

This is the repository associated to my video https://youtu.be/8b_6XvXuj8s in which I explain how we can create a tour of the application using the **Joyride** library.

What we will do is create a custom hook called `useTour` that will allow us to obtain a component that will paint a tour through a view of our application, showing a "popup" in each of the elements that we indicated.

In addition, this video will allow us to continue seeing new use cases for hooks, so it is also very useful in that sense. Specifically, we will review the `useEffect`, `useState` and `useMemo` hooks.

## Run the project

Use yarn start to run the app in the development mode and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
